# Titanic---Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster


This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning project on the Titanic dataset. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic based on various features.

## Dataset

The dataset is provided by Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). It includes two CSV files:
- `train.csv`: Training dataset with features and labels.
- `test.csv`: Test dataset without labels. You can use your model to predict survival on this dataset.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with data exploration, data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
- `data/`: Contains the dataset files.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Saved machine learning models.
- `results/`: Model evaluation results, plots, and visualization.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required to run the code.
- `LICENSE`: The project's license information.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-machine-learning.git
   cd titanic-machine-learning
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to understand the project workflow.

4. Run the scripts in the `scripts/` directory for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Usage

- Use the provided Jupyter notebooks and scripts to develop and evaluate your own models.
- Experiment with different feature engineering and model algorithms to improve prediction accuracy.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improvements or want to fix issues, please open a pull request.
